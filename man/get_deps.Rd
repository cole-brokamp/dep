\title{Get packages required to run all R code in a file}
\usage{
get_deps(fl)
}
\arguments{
\item{fl}{file to parse for required package names}
}
\value{
a vector of package names as character strings
}
\description{
Parses an R or R Markdown file for the package names that would be required to run the code.
}
\details{
This function uses regular expressions to search through a file
  containing R code to find required package names.  It extracts not only
  package names denoted by \code{\link[base]{library}} and \code{\link[base]{require}}, but also
  packages not attached to the global namespace, but are still called with
  \code{\link[base]{::}} or \code{\link[base]{:::}}.

  Because it relies on regular expressions, it assumes all packages adhere to
  the valid CRAN package name rules (contain only ASCII letters, numbers, and
  dot; have at least two characters and start with a letter and not end it a
  dot). Code is also tidying internally, making the code more predictable and
  easier to parse (removes comments, adds whitespace around operators, etc).
  R Markdown files are also supported by extracting only R code using
  \code{\link[knitr]{purl}}.
